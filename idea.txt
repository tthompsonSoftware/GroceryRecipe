My basic idea for this software will encompass a few simple ideas

- connect to a sql database that holds recipes ingredients
- Allow queries using js to the database using postman or something similar
- Eventually add a front end maybe with gui?
- Control sql changes using sql migrations or something similar to learn better database control
- Github Actions?
